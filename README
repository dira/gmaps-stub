h1. Stub google maps!

1. using GMaps - JS API? 
It is by no means slow, but it still consumes a couple of seconds on every load..

2. You are working on the page with the map but on something else (other JS, CSS, ui, etc)

3. Don't load GMaps. Load the stub.
Time saved: 2-3 seconds/per page load. Brain power: priceless.
