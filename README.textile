h1. Stub google maps!

h2. Using GMaps - JS API? 
It is by no means slow, but it still consumes a couple of seconds on every load..

h2. You are working on the map page but on something else? (other JS, CSS, ui, etc)
Don't let GMaps 'eat' your time on every load. Stub it.
Time saved: 2-3 seconds/per page load. Brain power: priceless.
