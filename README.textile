h1. Stub google maps!

*Using GMaps - JS API?*
It is by no means slow, but it still consumes a couple of seconds on every load..

*You are working on the map page but on something else?* (other JS, CSS, ui, etc)
Don't let GMaps 'eat' your time on every load. Stub it.
Time saved: 2-3 seconds/per page load. Brain power: priceless.
